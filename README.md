# **Keylogger & Screenlogger**

## **Overview**

This repository contains two Python scripts: a **Keylogger** and a **Screenlogger**. The **Keylogger** tracks keyboard input and logs it along with the active window title. Meanwhile, the **Screenlogger** captures periodic screenshots of your screen and uploads them to a designated webhook URL. 

These tools can be useful for personal productivity tracking, system monitoring, or remote access use cases. However, itâ€™s important to use them responsibly, respecting privacy and legal boundaries.

## **Keylogger**

### **Description**

The Keylogger script monitors keyboard activity and logs the captured keystrokes into a log file. It also tracks which window was active when each keystroke was registered. Every predefined period, the log file is sent to a specified webhook URL, allowing for secure and remote tracking.

### **Features**
- **Keystroke Logging:** Records every keystroke and identifies the active window.
- **Real-time Uploading:** Sends the log file periodically to a specified webhook URL.
- **Customizable Time Intervals:** Adjust the frequency of log file uploads.
- **Window Title Tracking:** Tracks which program is currently in focus while logging inputs.

### **Installation**

To get started with the Keylogger, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/keylogger-screenlogger.git
   cd keylogger-screenlogger
